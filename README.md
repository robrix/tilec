# `tilec` — the tile programming language (and eventually, its compiler)

tile is a dependently-typed programming language, but this package is mostly an experiment in language and compiler engineering.

I have some aspirations to quantitative type theory, higher-order unification, responsive compilation, levitation, and whole-program optimization, but for now I’m just trying to find my footing; don’t expect to be able to write programs in this any time soon.
